\section{Abstract}
%Your abstract is simply a short, standalone summary of the work or paper that others can use as an overview.[1] An abstract describes what you do in your essay, whether itâ€™s a scientific experiment or a literary analysis paper. It will help your reader to understand the paper and it will help people searching for a particular work to find it and decide whether it suits their purposes. Seeing as an abstract is only a summary of the work you've already done, it's easy to accomplish!

Galaxies form larger-scale structures known as clusters and super clusters. Tully et al \cite{tully_laniakea_2014} used the V-Web algorithm, developed by Hoffman et al\cite{hoffman_kinematic_2012}, on the flow map of the local universe \cite{tully_cosmicflows-2_2013} to define our home super cluster of galaxies, which they named Laniakea, which means infinite heaven in Hawaiian. 
\\
In this work we used similar techniques to detect galaxies super clusters in different simulations generated with the N-Body simulator Gadget-2 \cite{springel_gadget_2_2005}. The results of the simulation were read with the pyGadgetReader module \cite{thompson_pygadgetreader_2014ascl_soft11001T}. We performed different approaches using the velocities as a basis to detect different large-scale structures if the same order of magnitude as Laniakea (100 Mpc/h). We can then perform comparations of different properties of theses structures with our home super cluster, Laniakea.
