\section{Current or projected research activities and motives for wishing to attend the conference:}

Currently I’m working on my undergraduate physics thesis on computational cosmology, “Laniakea in a Cosmological Context” with Professor Jaime Forero 
at Universidad de los Andes, here in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia. I find the topic fascinating and I’m thrilled to be doing actual research.  
This conference is an incredible chance to immerse myself in the community, learn of all the different work that is being done and share my work. 
In addition to this work, I am also a research assistant in astronomical image processing for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). 
This work will be the foundation of my computing engineering senior thesis and is also related to this conference. 
Therefore the Large Scale Structures and Galaxy Flows conference is a great opportunity to interact and learn from leading researchers in the field, and to help focus my research interests as I start looking into graduate school possibilities.\\
I submitted the abstract of our work to the “Cosmic Flows” conference and got accepted to present in the Poster Session. I’m really looking forward to this life experience opportunity. \\
Nevertheless, Vietnam is quite far from Colombia (17,916 km from Bogota to Quy Nhon according to Google). I am therefore applying for financial support to help me cover the significant expenses (more than 1500 dollars in airfare alone). \\
I thank you very much for your time and help,\\
Sergio Daniel Hernández Charpak
