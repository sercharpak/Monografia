Current or projected research activities and motives for wishing to attend the conference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am currently working on my undergraduate physics thesis at
Los Andes University in Bogota, Colombia. The title
of my project is “Laniakea in a Cosmological Context”. I approach this
subject from the computational perspective, running N-body simulations
and developing algorithms to detect super-clusters from the peculiar
velocity information. I am doing this work under the advice of
Prof. Jaime Forero-Romero.  

I find numerical cosmology fascinating. I am thrilled to be tackling
a real research project on the topic. Your Vietnam Conference is the best
chance to meet the leading scientific community on my research
topic. I am eager to learn from them while I get the opportunity to
share my work. 

Besides my undergraduate thesis, I am also doing image processing
research for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) with in the
Computing Engineering Department.  This work will be the foundation of
my computing engineering senior thesis and is also related to this
conference.   

The Large Scale Structures and Galaxy Flows conference is clearly a
great opportunity to interact and learn from leading researchers in
the field. This will help me to find a focus of interest for my future
research and guide my choice for a subject to chose a Graduate School
next year.  

I submitted the abstract of my work to your conference and got it
accepted as a Poster presentation. I am really looking forward to
this life experience opportunity.    

Nevertheless, Vietnam is quite far from Colombia (17,916 km from
Bogota to Quy Nhon according to Google). I am therefore applying for
financial support to help me cover either the travel
expenses (tickets are around 1500 USD), the conference fee or my
accommodation. 
  
Thank you very much for your time and help.

Yours,

Sergio Daniel Hernández Charpak
