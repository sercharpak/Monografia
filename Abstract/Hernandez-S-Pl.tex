\begin{abstract} 
Recently Tully et al. (2014) used local cosmic flow information to
define our local supercluster, Laniakea. 
In this work we present a study on large cosmological N-body
simulations aimed at establishing the significance of Laniakea in a
cosmological context.
We explore different algorithms to define superclusters from the dark
matter velocity field in the simulation. 
We summarize the properties of the supercluster population by their
abundance at a given total mass and its shape distributions.
We find that superclusters similar in size and structure to Laniakea are
relatively uncommon on a broader cosmological context.
We finalize by discussing the possible sources of systematics (both in
our methods and in observations) leading to this discrepancy.
